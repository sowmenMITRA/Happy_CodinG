This is some of my daily problem solving using c and c++.
Here is the list of some of my code at my early days of coding;
1) 2s Binary search (https://github.com/sowmenMITRA/Happy_CodinG/blob/master/2s%20Complement%20of%20a%20Binary%20Number.c)
2) Binary search using recursion (https://github.com/sowmenMITRA/Happy_CodinG/blob/master/Binary%20Search%20using%20recursion.c)
